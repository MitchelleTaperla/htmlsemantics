I know how to draw, but I am not really good at it. I am hardworking, lovable, obedient, and forgetful. I am currently in a healthy relationship.I am a religious and conscientious individual.I also love cats and dogs, and I am currently studying at Saint Michael College of Caraga, taking the Bachelor of Information Technology. I am working hard to be the best version of myself and to help my family in the future. </p>

            <p>My childhood memories are the best part of my life. I remember when I used to play outside with my friends, cousin, and sister. We played hide and seek, balay-balay, tumba lata, jacks, marbles, and many more. I used to be late going home because it was too fun and enjoyable.Every memory is etched in my heart and mind for eternity.</p>

            <p>My life as a teenager is also memorable due to my friends , who are able to make me happy and help me explore new things. We enrolled in the same school, and we are also classmates. When it was time to go home, we used to sing on the road, celebrating each other's birthdays. We experience challenges in our friendship, but we still stay together. My friends and familyares my foundation of strength and happiness </p>

            <p>Aduldhood is a very crucial stage in one’s life. This is the climax of physical and health processes. This is the point in life when we make plans of our futures. It is the time when we think of what life will be like as an adult and make plans for the future. Most importantly, it is when we lay the starting point for developmental changes that we will undergo throughout our lives.</p>
